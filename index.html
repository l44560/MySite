      This is my <b>first paragraph<b>. I am going to write my <i> first paragraph. Hello everybody. Welcome to my personal website as you'll get to know me. Thank you for allowing me to share my personal journey.

      This is my second paragraph. I am going to write about something that I
      to do. Well, for starters, I like to write short stories. Hopefully, they'll turn into graphic novels. When I can, I like to travel
      around the country to experience some of its best attractions.
      This is my <b>first paragraph</b>. I am going to <i>write this paragraph</i>.
