      This is my <b>first paragraph<b>. I am going to write my <i> first paragraph. Hello everybody. Welcome to my personal website as you'll get to know me. Thank you for allowing me to share my personal journey.
      Hopefully it can inspire others who are trying to navigate this crazy maze that is called "Life."

      This is my second paragraph. I am going to write about something that I
      to do. Well, for starters, I like to write short stories. Hopefully, they'll turn into graphic novels. When I can, I like to travel
      around the country to experience some of its best attractions.
      This is my <b>first paragraph</b>. I am going to <i>write this paragraph</i>.
